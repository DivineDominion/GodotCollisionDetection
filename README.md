# Godot Collision Detection Demos

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Godot-3.2-informational)

Currently, this demonstrates two kinds of player nodes:

1. `Area2D` and manual position changes, the naive approach that will "teleport" the player to the destination, clipping through walls;
2. `KineticBody2D` and `move_and_collide` to make the physics engine calculate collisions from the current position up to the destination.
